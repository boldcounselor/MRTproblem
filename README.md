# MRTproblemGA
This is basically an adaptation of a genetic algorithm that is hopefully able to connect nodes with an assigned population value in an optimal way.

#Introduction
Given a ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$n$$) by ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$n$$) grid, there are ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$i$$) nodes that we want to connect where ![]https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$x&space;\in&space;[1,n^2])$, each with an associated population value ![]https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$p$ where ![]https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$p&space;\in&space;[1,255]$ and an associated ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$x$$) and ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$y$$) position where ![]https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$x,&space;y&space;\in&space;[0,n]$
